# Dirty data project 
## Task 1 - Decathlon

We are dealing with a data set containing results from two decathlon competitions - Decastar and Olympic Games

We have got results from all 10 disciplines for each competitor, depending on which competition they attended.

Some competitors attended both competitions.

Data set does not contain any missing values but needed to be cleaned.

* _data_cleaning_script.R_ - the data cleaning script to clean the raw data to get the data set ready for analysis (column heading unified to snake_case style, row names shifted to a column etc). It also contains description of the observations in the data.
 
* _decathlon_analysis.Rmd_ - contains the analysis and answers to the task question 

Both files are thoroughly commented on what steps have been taken.
